	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by problem to run and comple te the given task,  as a programm your
		goal should be to reduce the time
		complexity of the code by optimizing 
		it and make it more efficient</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount of 
		memory occupeid by the data,  for example if a program  takes an arry of size n as input, 
		the space complexity of the program become O(n)</p>
